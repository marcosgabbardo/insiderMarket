# API Authentication (Optional for Phase 1 - only needed for trading in Phase 3)
# Note: Polymarket CLOB API requires 3 credentials for authenticated operations:
# - API_KEY, API_SECRET, and API_PASSPHRASE
# These are generated together using your wallet's private key
# For now, Phase 1 only uses public read endpoints which don't require authentication
